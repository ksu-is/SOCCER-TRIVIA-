# SOCCER-TRIVIA-
IS 3020 PROJECT
The Soccer Trivia project will be an interactive and engaging application designed to test users' knowledge of soccer history, players, teams, and tournaments. The app will feature multiple difficulty levels—easy, medium, and hard—allowing users to choose a challenge that fits their knowledge. Questions will cover a broad range of topics, from famous players and iconic teams to historic World Cup moments and recent league stats. The application will include a timed quiz feature, where users can race against the clock to answer as many questions as possible, with a leaderboard to track high scores and encourage friendly competition among users.

To accomplish this, I will develop the application entirely using Python. The back-end will handle user interactions, score tracking, and API integration. I plan on using Python's Flask framework to build the server and integrate an API, such as football-data.org, to fetch live soccer data and dynamically generate trivia questions. User scores will be stored, and the app will provide a review of the answers at the end of each session. In the future, I aim to enhance the app with additional features, including multiplayer mode, question difficulty customization, and localization for a broader audience. This project will serve as a fun way for soccer enthusiasts to learn more about the sport while honing their trivia skills.
